<h2 id="second-release-candidate-of-210-released">Second Release Candidate of 2.1.0 released</h2>

<p>From quintus:</p>

<p>As the project lead of The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M. (TSC), I am
pleased to announce that the second Release Candidate (RC2) of the new
TSC version 2.1.0 is now available. The release has been tagged on the
Git repository as v2.1.0-rc2 and has been uploaded to our web server.
The source code can be found at the following URLs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source code:     https://ftp.secretchronicles.org/releases/TSC-2.1.0.rc2.tar.gz</li>
  <li>PGP signature:   https://ftp.secretchronicles.org/releases/TSC-2.1.0.rc2.tar.gz.sig</li>
  <li>MD5 checksum:    2b81a441cd963428bff46f19c2604150</li>
  <li>SHA256 checksum: 377600c13c4a16b249a3879d6d9169ca75ae476d97824218f29a91fe482a2fb1</li>
</ul>

<p>The TGZ file has a total size of slightly more than 240 MiB. Please
consider this before downloading.</p>

<p>We apologise for the delay since last RC version, but free-time
development tends to be difficult to coordinate.</p>

<h2 id="what-has-changed-since-rc1">What has changed since RC1?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Problem with the “Options” menu tab bar on  Hi-DPI displays was
probably fixed (ticket #681, problem found by Öyvind Sæther)</li>
  <li>Problem with character encoding in translated HUD messages was fixed</li>
  <li>New level desert_fortress</li>
  <li>Added three levels to world_3, including desert_fortress.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually these are more changes than there should be in an RC, but we
thought they’re small enough to include them directly. As a result, I
have decided to issue a second RC instead of the final release.</p>

<h2 id="when-can-we-expect-the-final-release">When can we expect the final release?</h2>

<p>This is the Second Release Candidate. If no serious problems are
discovered until 2020-05-03, version 2.1.0 is going to be released
shortly after that date.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-in-the-rc-phase">What happens in the RC phase?</h2>

<p>The code is now considered to be final for the upcoming release. The RC
phase is the last opportunity to test the game for serious problems;
minor problems will not be fixed. No further changes will be made that
are not related to serious problems. It is not expected that the game
still contains serious problems.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-help-tsc-as-a-user-now">Can I help TSC as a user now?</h2>

<p>You can test the RC2 and see if you find problems that prevent the game
from working. Please report such problems <a href="/en/download/#development-version">here</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues">on our bug tracker</a> (requires a GitHub account).</p>

<p>Sadly no nearly new level submissions were made during the beta phase, thus
version 2.1.0 will not contain much different levels from version 2.0.0.
Once version 2.1.0 has been released, we encourage all users to submit
quality levels for inclusion in a subsequent release.</p>
