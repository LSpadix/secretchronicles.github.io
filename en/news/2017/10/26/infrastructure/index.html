      <h1>Server Infrastructure Update</h1>

<p><strong>NOTICE: This article contains important information for mailinglist and forum users! Please read it carefully!</strong></p>

<p>On Sunday, 2017-10-15 our main server <code>alexandria</code> suffered from a
power outage at our sponsor’s datacenter that corrupted the SQL
database. Luckily, thanks to a working backup procedure it was
possible to restore all important data except for the very newest
posts on the Chessboard forum.</p>

<p>However, we have taken the server outage as an opportunity to finally
upgrade our long outdated server operating system (Debian 7) to the
current Debian 9. This upgrade has now been completed, and we
apologise for all the inconvenience that resulted from the procedure
which especially included the forum and mailinglists being
unavailable. Furthermore, former project lead Quintus (Marvin) has
announced to devote some time again into a rewrite of TSC for version
3.0.0. To support him in this, it was decided to shut down the
Chessboard instance at forum.secretchronicles.org as Chessboard is a
<a href="https://github.com/Quintus/chessboard">software written by Quintus himself</a> that would otherwise need
active maintenance by means of code changes in case security issues
arise. This way he can now concentrate on the actual TSC code.</p>

<p>This move however does not mean that there is no communication medium
left for TSC. First off, <a href="https://forum.secretchronicles.org/">forum.secretchronicles.org</a> has been
archived into a static copy that remains available for reference but
causes no maintenance problems anymore as it’s only static HTML now
(the copy has been created by means of <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a>). You cannot log
into that site thus anymore, and <em>all user accounts on that site have
been cancelled</em>.</p>

<p>The Chessboard instance has always been a frontend to two
mailinglists, tsc-users@lists.secretchronicles.org and
tsc-devel@lists.secretchronicles.org. These mailinglists were managed
with the <a href="http://mlmmj.org/">mlmmj</a> software whose lack of a web interface was the
primary reason why Chessboard had originally been written. Since that
time however, other mailinglist software has evolved. Most notably,
the standard mailinglist software, <a href="http://list.org/">GNU Mailman</a>, has seen a
drastic update in its web user interface. The old “Pipermail” UI was
dropped entirely in favour of a rewrite called “HyperKitty”, which
uses modern technology and makes for a nice and clean
experience. Consequently, the TSC project’s mailinglists have been
moved from mlmmj to Mailman. In order to ease the transition from
mlmmj+Chessboard to GNU Mailman however, <em>all subscriptions to both
tsc-devel and tsc-users have been cancelled</em>, just like the forum
accounts.</p>

<p>The primary domain for interaction with the project is now
<a href="https://lists.secretchronicles.org/">lists.secretchronicles.org</a>. On that website, you will find a nice
web interface that allows you to participate in the discussions on the
mailinglists without having to use email if you don’t like
to. HyperKitty should comfort all of those users who have complained
that Chessboard’s interface looks too old. If on the other hand you
prefer the email communication (and rightly so!), then this is of
course possible as well; the website allows you to choose between
subscription (email variant) or registration (web variant), or you can
use both if you like to, in which case you should first register and
then subscribe.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore: Everyone still interested in the TSC community</strong> has to visit the
website at <a href="https://lists.secretchronicles.org/">lists.secretchronicles.org</a> <strong>and subscribe there to the
email versions of the desired lists</strong> and/or <strong>create an account in
order to be able to use the web interface</strong> for posting.</p>

<p>Since all of this infrastructure is now completely new, it might well
be that there are errors and problems. Don’t hesitate to contact us,
ideally by posting to the tsc-users mailinglist, either via email, or
via HyperKitty.</p>

<p>Another aspect revisited during the upgrade was our IRC bot,
<a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/furbot">furbot</a>, that has seen a general software upgrade which especially
involved a facelift of the IRC logs. If you now visit
<a href="https://chatlogs.secretchronicles.org/">chatlogs.secretchronicles.org</a>, you’ll hopefully be pleasently
surprised by the improved readability of the newer chatlogs (old logs
have not been altered). The most annoying bug in the chatlogs, furbot
repeating itself multiple times after it got disconnected from IRC,
has been resolved as well.</p>

<p>The plans to move the ticket system to <code>alexandria</code> are placed on
hold for the moment due to lack of time. The mlmmj to Mailman
conversion with the removal of Chessboard plus the OS upgrade have
consumed quite a bit of time. Those plans are not given up, though.</p>

<p>Many thanks go to Lauri (xet7) who conducted the OS upgrade, to
Quintus for moving Chessboard+mlmmj to Mailman, and to <a href="http://first-root.com/">First-Root
UG</a> to the continued sponsorship of the project in form of the
<code>alexandria</code> server.</p>
