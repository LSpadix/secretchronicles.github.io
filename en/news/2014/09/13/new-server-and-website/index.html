      </p>
      
      
<p>After long discussions on IRC and the old SMC forums, we have finally
decided to declare this project an official <em>fork</em> of the <a href="http://www.secretmaryo.org">Secretmaryo
Chronicles project</a>. From this day on, we are no longer a simple
continuation of that project, but rather a project of our own, with
our own goals, and, hopefully, our own new name. This website
currently does mention <em>Secretchronicles</em> as the name of the
project, but as outlined on the start page, this is not final yet and
subject to change, because we do not want to keep the “SMC”
acronym. Please feel free to give your input to the discussion, either
on <a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues/92">ticket #92</a> or in IRC; note we already had a channel
<code>#secretchronicles</code> on <code>freenode.net</code> for a while.</p>

<div class="img-right">

<p>First Root is sponsoring us. Thanks!</p>
</div>

<p>Note we are in the process of changing our infrastructure. We have
been kindly granted a free virtual server by the German company <a href="http://www.first-root.com">First
Root UG</a>, to whom I express my explicit gratitude. Additionally, I
have purchased the domain <code>secretchronicles.org</code> so that we can now
unite all of our infrastructure on a single domain and server.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the websites on Secretchronicles that were
previously scattered around my private <code>quintilianus.eu</code> domain will
now be moved gradually over to the new <code>secretchronicles.org</code>
domain. The sites hosted on my private server and even on my Raspberry
Pi will be moved over to the new server. This process will take time,
but I will continue to inform you on this blog. As of this writing,
the following sites have already been moved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The scripting forum from <code>smc.quintilianus.eu</code> has been moved to
<code>forum.secretchronicles.org</code>.</li>
  <li>The chatlogs have been moved from <code>secretmaryo.quintilianus.eu</code>
to <code>chatlogs.secretchronicles.org</code>.</li>
  <li><em>furbot</em>, our helpful IRC bot, now runs on <code>alexandria</code>, which is the
nickname of our new server.</li>
  <li>A new website (this one) has been added as <code>secretchronicles.org</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please help us to give this fork the necessary momentum it needs to
evolve and grow, so that the old SMC gains new life with new
goals. Currently, we are shortly before the 2.0.0 release, with
2.0.0-beta3 being the current beta version. Test it, and give
feedback.</p>

<p>Vale,<br />
Quintus.</p>
