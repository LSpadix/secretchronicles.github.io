      </p>
      
      
<p>Today is a great day. After weeks of discussion, we have finally come
to a decision on the issue ticket numbered <a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues/92">#92</a>, which was the
main place where the discussion around our project name was
happening. We have departed from the <a href="http://secretmaryo.org">SMC project</a> in our goals
already, but the game still announced itself under this name. From
today, we are now to be known under the following name:</p>

<h3 id="the-secret-chronicles-of-dr-m">The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.</h3>

<p>Dr. M., whose full name has not yet been decided on, will be the
villain of a new and darker story which will probably be centered
around libraries and ancient ruins. The current draft of the story,
which is being authored by datahead, is available <a href="https://wiki.secretchronicles.org/Story%20Development%20Document%20-%20Version%202">on our wiki</a>,
and any contribution to our story is appreciated. You may join <a href="https://forum.secretchronicles.org">our
forums</a> or visit us on IRC in <code>#secretchronicles</code> on Freenode.</p>

<p>Having found a name for our fork, it now is time to also design a new
logo, as the old SMC one obviously cannot be used anymore. <a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues/203">An issue
ticket</a> has been created to take care of the task, and we welcome
every suggestion on a new logo for the game.</p>

<p>Apart from the logo, we also need many different artistic
contributions. If you feel you have artistic capabilities with regard
to creating graphics or music, you can browse our issue tracker with a
filter applied for the <a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AGraphics">Graphics</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Music+%26+Sounds%22">Music &amp; Sounds</a>. There is plenty to do,
and chances are your contributions will be included quickly into the
game, as we strive to make a difference from the SMC project. Among
those tickets, the one regarding <a href="https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC/issues/103">removal and replacement of the
Mario-style music</a> deserves a specific mention, as it is of utmost
importance to us to depart from the Mario roots of the SMC project. To
the current day, however, we do not have had enough background music
contribution to allow for the removal of the remixes without leaving a
large gap behind us, hindering both level designers and players of the
game.</p>

<p>In parallel to this article, the fourth beta version of the now
renamed fork is being made available. You will soon be able to
download it from the <a href="/en/download/">corresponding page</a>, and we appreciate any
tests of it, as they aid us in creating a stable 2.0.0 release.</p>

<p>Finally, I am proud to say we have set up a mailinglist to help us
developing the game. The list has no online archives at the moment,
but we are working on setting those up. In the meantime, we invite you
to subscribe and participate on <code>tsc-devel@lists.secretchronicles.org</code>
by sending an empty email (subject does not matter) to
<code>tsc-devel+subscribe@lists.secretchronicles.org</code>. You will receive a
confirmation email with further instructions, which when followed will
grant you read and post access to the otherwise public mailinglist.</p>

<p>Help us moving the game forward.</p>

<p>Valete,<br />
Quintus.</p>
